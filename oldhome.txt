MUSIC & RESOURCES TO CREATE A PROFOUND LIFE


<h3 class="letter-space mb-4" style="text-align: center;">WELCOME</h3>
My name is Steven Horkey and Everything In All is an endeavor of mine where I seek to learn, understand, and embody a life well lived. It's also a music project, and I personally see neither as mutually exclusive.

I likely don't know anything that you don't already know yourself deep down, but I do have an earnest desire to be a decent person and be part of the general solution instead of the general problem.

More than anything, this site is for me. It's gradually becoming the resource I want to see and use within the space of personal development. I don't have anything to sell, but I guess my broader request is that you make a commitment to think for yourself, take ownership for the quality of your life, and remain open.

This is about approaching our time here in a more sincere way, one that is grounded in humility and an honest connection amidst our shared human condition.

I have yet to find anything more valuable than the process of cultivating a greater connection to one's own self, one another,
and this life we are all a part of.
<p style="text-align: center;">In the most loving and transparent sense, live better.</p>
